<Image src={require('./5.png')} alt="Screenshot of a section comparing Next.js 13 with Turbo to other frameworks and build systems. The headline says “Faster Than Fast.” There’s a subheadline and a horizontal menu that looks like a toggle. The selected item is “Cold Start.” Below is the chart, which consists of four bars with an area filled out that indicates how fast it loaded. The bar that says “Next.js 13 turbo” has the least amount filled out, meaning it was the fastest." caption="Chart comparing build times between Next.js 13, using Turbo, with Vite and previous versions of Next.js." />

The background has a pattern of scares that are titled to give a 3D effect as it feels like the background has perspective. There’s a row of logos from large companies such as AWS and Microsoft. Below is a traditional footer with columns of links to different areas of the site, a Vercel logo and copyright notice, and an email newsletter signup form." caption="Footer section with logos of large companies using Turbo.
