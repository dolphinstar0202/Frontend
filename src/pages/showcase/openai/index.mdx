The top section contains headlines for the four main areas of the website with a call-to-action link below. The bottom section has a cool graphic with colored lines in grainy, gradient colors going from purple to green on the left side and a description of ChatGPT on the right side. There are call-to-action links to try or read about ChatGPT below the description." caption="Section featuring the four main areas of the website and highlighting the recently launched ChatGPT product." />

<Image src={require('./10.png')} alt="Screenshot of the hero section of the OpenAI website about page. The headline is to the left, and the subheadline is to the right.

<Image src={require('./11.png')} alt="Screenshot of the OpenAI website footer. The footer starts in one color at the bottom and features horizontal lines that get taller and taller with more and more spacing until the background color ultimately changes — giving a cool fade effect. The two colors used on this page are light orange and dark cyan. Above the fade pattern are a copyright notice, links to terms, a link to go back to the top, and links to social profiles." caption="Striped pattern in the OpenAI website footer is repeated across the site in different colors." />
