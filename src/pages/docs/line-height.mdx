## Basic usage

### Relative line-heights

Use the `leading-none`, `leading-tight`, `leading-snug`, `leading-normal`, `leading-relaxed`, and `leading-loose` utilities to give an element a relative line-height based on its current font-size.

<Example>
  <div class="flex flex-col gap-8">
    <div>
      <span class="font-medium text-sm text-slate-500 font-mono mb-3 dark:text-slate-400">leading-normal</span>
      <p class="leading-normal text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-200">
        So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span class="font-medium text-sm text-slate-500 font-mono mb-3 dark:text-slate-400">leading-relaxed</span>
      <p class="leading-relaxed text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-200">
        So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span class="font-medium text-sm text-slate-500 font-mono mb-3 dark:text-slate-400">leading-loose</span>
      <p class="leading-loose text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-200">
        So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</Example>

```html
<p class="**leading-normal** ...">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
<p class="**leading-relaxed** ...">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
<p class="**leading-loose** ...">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```

### Fixed line-heights

Use the `leading-{size}` utilities to give an element a fixed line-height, irrespective of the current font-size. These are useful when you need very precise control over an element's final size.

<Example>
  <div class="flex flex-col gap-8">
    <div>
      <span class="font-medium text-sm text-slate-500 font-mono mb-3 dark:text-slate-400">leading-6</span>
      <p class="leading-6 text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-200">
        So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span class="font-medium text-sm text-slate-500 font-mono mb-3 dark:text-slate-400">leading-7</span>
      <p class="leading-7 text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-200">
        So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span class="font-medium text-sm text-slate-500 font-mono mb-3 dark:text-slate-400">leading-8</span>
      <p class="leading-8 text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-200">
        So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</Example>

```html
<p class="**leading-6** ...">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
<p class="**leading-7** ...">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
<p class="**leading-8** ...">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```

### Overriding default line-heights

It's important to note that by default, Tailwind's [font-size](/docs/font-size) utilities each set their own default line-height. This means that any time you use a responsive font-size utility like `sm:text-xl`, any explicit line-height you have set for a smaller breakpoint will be overridden.

```html
<!-- The `leading-loose` class will be overridden at the `md` breakpoint -->
<p class="text-lg leading-loose md:text-xl">
  Maybe we can live without libraries...
</p>
```

If you want to override the default line-height after setting a breakpoint-specific font-size, make sure to set a breakpoint-specific line-height as well:

```html
<!-- The `leading-loose` class will be overridden at the `md` breakpoint -->
<p class="text-lg leading-loose md:text-xl md:leading-loose">
  Maybe we can live without libraries...
</p>
```

Using the same line-height across different font sizes is generally not going to give you good typographic results. Line-height should typically get smaller as font-size increases, so the default behavior here usually saves you a ton of work. If you find yourself fighting it, you can always [customize your font-size scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-size#customizing) to not include default line-heights.

## Using custom values

### Customizing your theme

By default, Tailwind provides six relative and eight fixed `line-height` utilities. You change, add, or remove these by customizing the `lineHeight` section of your Tailwind theme config.

```diff-js tailwind.config.js
  module.exports = {
    theme: {
      extend: {
+       lineHeight: {
+         'extra-loose': '2.5',
+         '12': '3rem',
+       }
      }
    }
  }
```

Learn more about customizing the default theme in the [theme customization](/docs/theme#customizing-the-default-theme) documentation.

### Arbitrary values

<ArbitraryValues property="line-height" featuredClass="leading-[3rem]" element="p" />
