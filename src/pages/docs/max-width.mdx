## Basic usage

### Setting the maximum width

Set the maximum width of an element using the `max-w-{size}` utilities.

<Example resizable>
  <div class="overflow-hidden relative max-w-md mx-auto bg-white shadow-lg ring-1 ring-black/5 rounded-xl flex items-center gap-6 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:highlight-white/5">
    <img class="absolute -left-6 w-28 h-28 rounded-full shadow-lg" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501196354995-cbb51c65aaea?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=facearea&facepad=4&w=256&h=256&q=80" />
    <div class="min-w-0 py-5 pl-28 pr-5">
      <div class="text-slate-900 font-medium text-sm sm:text-base truncate dark:text-slate-200">Andrew Alfred</div>
      <div class="text-slate-500 font-medium text-sm sm:text-base leading-tight truncate dark:text-slate-400">Assistant to the Traveling Secretary</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</Example>

```html
<div class="**max-w-md** ...">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

### Reading width

The `max-w-prose` utility gives an element a max-width optimized for readability and adapts based on the font size.

<Example>
  <div class="space-y-8">
    <div>
      <span class="font-medium text-sm text-slate-500 font-mono mb-3">text-sm</span>
      <div class="max-w-prose text-sm font-medium text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-200">
        <p>Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span class="font-medium text-sm text-slate-500 font-mono mb-3">text-base</span>
      <div class="max-w-prose text-base font-medium text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-200">
        <p>Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span class="font-medium text-sm text-slate-500 font-mono mb-3">text-xl</span>
      <div class="max-w-prose text-xl font-medium text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-200">
        <p>Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</Example>

```html
<div class="text-sm **max-w-prose** ...">
  <p>Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.</p>
</div>

<div class="text-base **max-w-prose** ...">
  <p>Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.</p>
</div>

<div class="text-xl **max-w-prose** ...">
  <p>Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.</p>
</div>
```

### Constraining to your breakpoints

The `max-w-screen-{breakpoint}` classes can be used to give an element a max-width matching a specific breakpoint. These values are automatically derived from the [`theme.screens` section](/docs/theme#screens) of your `tailwind.config.js` file.

```html
<div class="max-w-screen-2xl">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

### <Heading ignore>Hover, focus, and other states</Heading>

## Using custom values

### Customizing your theme

You can customize your `max-width` scale by editing `theme.maxWidth` or `theme.extend.maxWidth` in your `tailwind.config.js` file.

```diff-js tailwind.config.js
  module.exports = {
    theme: {
+     maxWidth: {
+       '1/2': '50%',
+     }
    }
  }
```

Learn more about customizing the default theme in the [theme customization](/docs/theme#customizing-the-default-theme) documentation.

### Arbitrary values

<ArbitraryValues property="max-width" featuredClass="max-w-[50%]" />
