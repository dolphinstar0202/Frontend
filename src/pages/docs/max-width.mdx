## Basic usage

### Setting the maximum width

Set the maximum width of an element using the `max-w-*` utilities.

```html {{ example: { resizable: true }, }}
<div class="grid gap-4 font-mono font-bold text-xs text-center text-white align-start">
  <div class="grid bg-stripes-blue w-full rounded-lg">
    <div class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 rounded-lg shadow-lg max-w-96">max-w-96</div>
  </div>
  <div class="grid bg-stripes-blue w-full rounded-lg">
    <div class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 rounded-lg shadow-lg max-w-80">max-w-80</div>
  </div>
  <div class="grid bg-stripes-blue w-full rounded-lg">
    <div class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 rounded-lg shadow-lg max-w-64">max-w-64</div>
  </div>
  <div class="grid bg-stripes-blue w-full rounded-lg">
    <div class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 rounded-lg shadow-lg max-w-48">max-w-48</div>
  </div>
  <div class="grid bg-stripes-blue w-full rounded-lg">
    <div class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 rounded-lg shadow-lg max-w-40">max-w-40</div>
  </div>
  <div class="grid bg-stripes-blue w-full rounded-lg">
    <div class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 rounded-lg shadow-lg max-w-32">max-w-32</div>
  </div>
  <div class="grid bg-stripes-blue w-full rounded-lg">
    <div class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 rounded-lg shadow-lg max-w-24">max-w-24</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```html
<div>
  <div class="w-full **max-w-96** ...">max-w-96</div>
  <div class="w-full **max-w-80** ...">max-w-80</div>
  <div class="w-full **max-w-64** ...">max-w-64</div>
  <div class="w-full **max-w-48** ...">max-w-48</div>
  <div class="w-full **max-w-40** ...">max-w-40</div>
  <div class="w-full **max-w-32** ...">max-w-32</div>
  <div class="w-full **max-w-24** ...">max-w-24</div>
</div>
```

### Sizing large elements

Above `24rem`, the `max-w-*` utilities use a named scale instead of a numeric scale to make the values easier to guess.

```html {{ example: { resizable: true } }}
<div class="overflow-hidden relative max-w-md mx-auto bg-white shadow-lg ring-1 ring-black/5 rounded-xl flex items-center gap-6 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:highlight-white/5">
  <img class="absolute -left-6 w-28 h-28 rounded-full shadow-lg" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501196354995-cbb51c65aaea?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=facearea&facepad=4&w=256&h=256&q=80" />
  <div class="min-w-0 py-5 pl-28 pr-5">
    <div class="text-slate-900 font-medium text-sm sm:text-base truncate dark:text-slate-200">Andrew Alfred</div>
    <div class="text-slate-500 text-sm sm:text-base leading-tight truncate dark:text-slate-400">Assistant to the Traveling Secretary</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```html
<div class="**max-w-md** ...">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

### Reading width

The `max-w-prose` utility gives an element a max-width optimized for readability and adapts based on the font size.

```html {{ example: true }}
<div class="space-y-8">
  <div>
    <span class="font-medium text-sm text-slate-500 font-mono mb-3">text-sm</span>
    <div class="max-w-prose text-sm font-medium text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-200">
      <p>Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollar idea right there. Just sell the tops.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <span class="font-medium text-sm text-slate-500 font-mono mb-3">text-base</span>
    <div class="max-w-prose text-base font-medium text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-200">
      <p>Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollar idea right there. Just sell the tops.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <span class="font-medium text-sm text-slate-500 font-mono mb-3">text-xl</span>
    <div class="max-w-prose text-xl font-medium text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-200">
      <p>Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollar idea right there. Just sell the tops.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```html
<div class="text-sm **max-w-prose** ...">
  <p>Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollar idea right there. Just sell the tops.</p>
</div>

<div class="text-base **max-w-prose** ...">
  <p>Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollar idea right there. Just sell the tops.</p>
</div>

<div class="text-xl **max-w-prose** ...">
  <p>Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollar idea right there. Just sell the tops.</p>
</div>
```

### Constraining to your breakpoints

The `max-w-screen-{breakpoint}` classes can be used to give an element a max-width matching a specific breakpoint. These values are automatically derived from the [`theme.screens` section](/docs/theme#screens) of your `tailwind.config.js` file.

```html
<div class="max-w-screen-2xl">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

---

## <Heading ignore>Applying conditionally</Heading>

### <Heading ignore>Hover, focus, and other states</Heading>

<HoverFocusAndOtherStates defaultClass="max-w-sm" featuredClass="max-w-lg" />

### <Heading ignore>Breakpoints and media queries</Heading>

<BreakpointsAndMediaQueries defaultClass="max-w-sm" featuredClass="max-w-lg" />

---

## Using custom values

### Customizing your theme

By default, Tailwind's maximum width scale is a combination of the [default spacing scale](/docs/customizing-spacing#default-spacing-scale) as well as some additional values specific to widths.

You can customize your spacing scale by editing `theme.spacing` or `theme.extend.spacing` in your `tailwind.config.js` file.

```diff-js {{ filename: 'tailwind.config.js' }}
  module.exports = {
    theme: {
      extend: {
+       spacing: {
+         '128': '32rem',
+       }
      }
    }
  }
```

To customize `max-width` separately, use the `theme.maxWidth` section of your `tailwind.config.js` file.

```diff-js {{ filename: 'tailwind.config.js' }}
  module.exports = {
    theme: {
      extend: {
+       maxWidth: {
+         '128': '32rem',
+       }
      }
    }
  }
```

### Arbitrary values

<ArbitraryValues property="max-width" featuredClass="max-w-[220px]" />
