import utilities from 'utilities?plugin=breakBefore'
import { BreakpointsAndMediaQueries } from '@/components/BreakpointsAndMediaQueries'
import { HoverFocusAndOtherStates } from '@/components/HoverFocusAndOtherStates'

export const classes = { utilities }

## Basic usage

### Setting the break-before behavior

Use the `break-before-{value}` utilities to control how a column or page break should behave before an element. For example, use the `break-before-column` utility to force a column break before an element.

```html
<div class="columns-2">
  <p>Well, let me tell you something, ...</p>
  <p class="**break-before-column**">Sure, go ahead, laugh...</p>
  <p>Maybe we can live without...</p>
  <p>Look. If you think this is...</p>
</div>
```
