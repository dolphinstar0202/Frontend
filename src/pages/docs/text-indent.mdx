## Basic usage

### Adding a text indent

Use the `indent-{width}` utilities to set the amount of empty space (indentation) that's shown before text in a block.

<Example p="none">
  <div class="bg-white p-8 shadow-xl text-slate-700 max-w-md mx-auto overflow-auto leading-6 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-slate-400">
    <p class="indent-8">
      So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was
      terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers
      a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention
      or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment,
      I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
    </p>
  </div>
</Example>

```html
<p class="**indent-8**">
  So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was
  terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers
  a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention
  or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment,
  I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
</p>
```

### Using negative values

To use a negative text indent value, prefix the class name with a dash to convert it to a negative value.

```html
<div class="**-indent-8**">
  So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to...
</div>
```

## Using custom values

### Customizing your theme

The default text indent scale is based on the [default spacing scale](/docs/customizing-spacing#default-spacing-scale). You can customize your spacing scale by editing `theme.spacing` or `theme.extend.spacing` in your `tailwind.config.js` file.

```diff-js tailwind.config.js
  module.exports = {
    theme: {
      extend: {
+       spacing: {
+         '128': '32rem',
+       }
      }
    }
  }
```

Alternatively, you can customize just the text indent scale by editing `theme.textIndent` or `theme.extend.textIndent` in your `tailwind.config.js` file.

```diff-js tailwind.config.js
  module.exports = {
    theme: {
      extend: {
+       textIndent: {
+         '128': '32rem',
+       }
      }
    }
  }
```

Learn more about customizing the default theme in the [theme customization](/docs/theme#customizing-the-default-theme) documentation.

### Arbitrary values

<ArbitraryValues property="text-indent" featuredClass="indent-[50%]" />
