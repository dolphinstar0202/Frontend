## <Heading hidden>Overview</Heading>

Tailwind follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), so we never introduce breaking changes until a new major release _(v2.0 is the next one)_.

Rather than drop a bunch of breaking changes on you at once though, we use feature flags as an incremental adoption strategy so you can opt-in to breaking changes early, and save the upgrade hassle down the road.

The following breaking changes are currently available in Tailwind behind flags.

## Remove deprecated gap utilities

Tailwind v1.7.0 introduced new `gap-x-{n}` and `gap-y-{n}` utilities to replace the existing `col-gap-{n}` and `row-gap-{n}` utilities. We currently include both by default, but the old utilities will be removed in v2.0.

To opt-in to removing them now, use the `removeDeprecatedGapUtilities` flag:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  future: {
    removeDeprecatedGapUtilities: true,
  },
  // ...
}
```

## Purge layers by default

Tailwind v1.8.0 introduced new `layers` purge mode which will be the default in v2.0. It purges all layers (`base`, `components`, and `utilities`) by default, whereas the previous default mode (`conservative`, now deprecated) only purged the `utilities` layer.

With the introduction of the new `preserveHtmlElements` purge option (which is `true` by default), we consider this more aggressive purging mode very safe, and it is unlikely to actually be a breaking change in your application.

You should see an even smaller CSS file by default with the new `layers` mode enabled, and shouldn't see any negative consequences unless you were deliberately relying on the fact that Tailwind was previously not purging the `base` or `components` layers by default.

To opt-in to using the new `layers` mode by default, use the `purgeLayersByDefault` flag:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  future: {
    purgeLayersByDefault: true,
  },
  // ...
}
```

If you'd like to only purge the `utilities` layer (like the `conservative` mode did), you can still opt-in with this flag, but then explicitly specify that you'd only like to purge the `utilities` layer:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  future: {
    purgeLayersByDefault: true,
  },
  purge: {
    layers: ['utilities'],
    content: [
      // Paths to your templates...
    ],
  },
  // ...
}
```
