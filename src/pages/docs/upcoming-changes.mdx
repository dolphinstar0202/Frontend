## <Heading hidden>Overview</Heading>

Tailwind follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), so we never introduce breaking changes until a new major release _(v2.0 is the next one)_.

Rather than drop a bunch of breaking changes on you at once though, we use feature flags as an incremental adoption strategy so you can opt-in to breaking changes early, and save the upgrade hassle down the road.

The following breaking changes are currently available in Tailwind behind flags.

## Remove deprecated gap utilities

Tailwind v1.7.0 introduced new `gap-x-{n}` and `gap-y-{n}` utilities to replace the existing `col-gap-{n}` and `row-gap-{n}` utilities. We currently include both by default, but the old utilities will be removed in v2.0.

To opt-in to removing the now, use the `removeDeprecatedGapUtilities` flag:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  future: {
    removeDeprecatedGapUtilities: true,
  },
  // ...
}
```
