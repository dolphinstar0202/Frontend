import utilities from 'utilities?plugin=willChange'

import { HoverFocusAndOtherStates } from '@/components/HoverFocusAndOtherStates'

export const classes = { utilities }

## Basic usage

### Optimizing with will change

Use `will-change-scroll`, `will-change-contents` and `will-change-transform` to optimize an element that's expected to change in the near future by instructing the browser to prepare the necessary animation before it actually begins.

```html
<div class="overflow-auto **will-change-scroll**">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

It's recommended that you apply these utilities just before an element changes, and then remove it shortly after it finishes using `will-change-auto`.

The will-change property is intended to be used as a last resort when dealing with **known performance problems**. Avoid using these utilities too much, or simply in anticipation of performance issues, as it could actually cause the page to be less performant.

## Using custom values

### Customizing your theme

By default, Tailwind provides four `will-change` utilities. You can customize these values by editing `theme.willChange` or `theme.extend.willChange` in your `tailwind.config.js` file.

```diff-js tailwind.config.js
  module.exports = {
    theme: {
      extend: {
+       willChange: {
+         'left-top': 'left, top',
+       }
      }
    }
  }
```

Learn more about customizing the default theme in the [theme customization](/docs/theme#customizing-the-default-theme) documentation.

### Arbitrary values

<ArbitraryValues property="will-change" featuredClass="will-change-[top,left]" />
