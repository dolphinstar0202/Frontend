## Creating your project

Start by creating a new Next.js project if you don't have one set up already. The most common approach is to use [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app):

```shell
npx create-next-app my-project
cd my-project
```

## Setting up Tailwind CSS

### Install Tailwind via npm

Install Tailwind and its peer-dependencies using `npm`:

```shell
# If you're on Next.js v10
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

# If you're on Next.js 9 or older
npm install tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9
```

### Create your configuration files

Next, generate your `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files:

```shell
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

This will create a minimal `tailwind.config.js` file at the root of your project:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
```

Learn more about configuring Tailwind in the [configuration documentation](/docs/configuration).

It will also create a `postcss.config.js` file that includes `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` already configured:

```js
// postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  }
}
```

If you're planning to use any other PostCSS plugins, you should read our documentation on [using PostCSS as your preprocessor](/docs/using-with-preprocessors) for more details about the best way to order them alongside Tailwind.

### Configure Tailwind to remove unused styles in production

In your `tailwind.config.js` file, configure the `purge` option with the paths to all of your pages and components so Tailwind can tree-shake unused styles in production builds:

```diff-js
  // tailwind.config.js
  module.exports = {
-   purge: [],
+   purge: ['./pages/**/*.js', './components/**/*.js'],
    darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
    theme: {
      extend: {}
    },
    variants: {},
    plugins: []
  }
```

Read our separate guide on [optimizing for production](/docs/optimizing-for-production) to learn more about tree-shaking unused styles for best performance.

### Include Tailwind in your CSS

When including Tailwind in your CSS in a Next.js project, there are two approaches you can take.

#### Import Tailwind directly in your JS

If you aren't planning to write any custom CSS in your project, the fastest way to include Tailwind is to import it directly in `pages/_app.js`:

```diff-js
  // pages/_app.js
- import '../styles/globals.css'
+ import "tailwindcss/tailwind.css";

  function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
    return <Component {...pageProps} />
  }

  export default MyApp
```

If you aren't planning to use them, you can safely delete any CSS files Next.js creates for you by default like `globals.css` and `Home.module.css`. Make sure you delete any references to them within your components as well.

#### Include Tailwind in a CSS file

If you _are_ planning to write some custom CSS in your project, use the `@tailwind` directive to include Tailwind's `base`, `components`, and `utilities` styles inside your main CSS file.

You can use the `globals.css` file that is included when you create a Next.js application, or create your own CSS file from scratch.

```css
/* ./styles/global.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Tailwind will swap these directives out at build-time with all of the styles it generates based on your configured design system.

Read our documentation on [adding base styles](/docs/adding-base-styles), [extracting components](/docs/extracting-components), and [adding new utilities](/docs/adding-new-utilities) for best practices on extending Tailwind with your own custom CSS.

Finally, ensure your CSS file is being imported in your `pages/_app.js` component:

```js
// pages/_app.js
import '../styles/globals.css'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

export default MyApp
```

If you've chosen to use a different file than the default `globals.css` file, you'll want to update the import accordingly.

You're finished! Now when you run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server, Tailwind CSS will be ready to use in your project.
