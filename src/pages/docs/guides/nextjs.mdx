# Using Tailwind CSS with NextJS

## Creating your project

Start by creating a new NextJS project if you don't have one set up already. The most common approach is to use [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app):

```shell
npx create-next-app my-project
```

## Setting up Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS v2.0 requires PostCSS 8 which is only available in Next.js >= 10.0.0.

Install Tailwind and Autoprefixer using `npm` or `yarn`:

```shell
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

Next, let's generate default `tailwind.config.js` **and** `postcss.config.js` files:

```shell
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

In our newly generated `tailwind.config.js` file, we'll configure the `purge` key with an array of file paths we want to be scanned. You may need to adjust this based on your specific needs.

```diff-js
module.exports = {
  // ...,
-  purge: [],
+  purge: ['./pages/**/*.js', './components/**/*.js'],
  theme: {
    extend: {}
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: []
}
```

In our NextJS project, within the `styles` directory, let's create a new file called `tailwind.css`. This file will contain three `@tailwind` declaratives:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

[See this in the code example &rarr;](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-integration-guides/blob/master/guides/nextjs/example/styles/tailwind.css#L1-L3)

Next, let's open the `_app.js` file located in our NextJS project's `pages` directory.

At the top of that file, we'll import our new `tailwind.css` file:

```js
import "../styles/tailwind.css";
```

That's it! Tailwind CSS is now available throughout our entire application ðŸŽ‰
