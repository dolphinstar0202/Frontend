# Using Tailwind CSS with Create React App

## Creating your project

Start by creating a new Create React App project if you don't have one set up already:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-project
```

## Setting up Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind, Autoprefixer and CRACO using `npm` or `yarn`:

```sh
npm install tailwindcss autoprefixer@^9 @craco/craco
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Note that at the time of writing this guide, we need to stick to version 9 of Autoprefixer. This will go away when NextJS internally upgrades to PostCSS 8, at what point we'll update this guide! üòÖ

Next, let's generate default `tailwind.config.js`:

```sh
npx tailwindcss init
```

Then, let's create a `craco.config.js` at the root of our project, with the following settings:

```javascript
// craco.config.js
module.exports = {
  style: {
    postcss: {
      plugins: [require("tailwindcss"), require("autoprefixer")],
    },
  },
};
```

Now, let's replace the content of `src/index.css` with the following:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

That's it! Tailwind CSS is now available throughout our entire application üéâ
