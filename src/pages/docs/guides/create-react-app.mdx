```preval installation

  link: https://create-react-app.dev/
script: npx create-react-app
```

```preval setup
version: compat-7
```

### Install and configure CRACO

Since Create React App doesn't let you override the PostCSS configuration natively, we also need to install [CRACO](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco) to be able to configure Tailwind:

```shell
npm install @craco/craco
```

Once it's installed, update your `scripts` in your `package.json` file to use `craco` instead of `react-scripts` for all scripts except `eject`:

```diff-json
  {
    // ...
    "scripts": {
-     "start": "react-scripts start",
-     "build": "react-scripts build",
-     "test": "react-scripts test",
+     "start": "craco start",
+     "build": "craco build",
+     "test": "craco test",
      "eject": "react-scripts eject"
    },
  }
```

Next, create a `craco.config.js` at the root of our project and add the `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` as PostCSS plugins:

```js
// craco.config.js
module.exports = {
  style: {
    postcss: {
      plugins: [
        require('tailwindcss'),
        require('autoprefixer'),
      ],
    },
  },
}
```

If you're planning to use any other PostCSS plugins, you should read our documentation on [using PostCSS as your preprocessor](/docs/using-with-preprocessors) for more details about the best way to order them alongside Tailwind.

```preval configuration
version: compat-7
postcss: false
types:
  - components
purge:
  - ./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}
  - ./public/index.html
```

```preval include
file: ./src/index.css
```

Finally, ensure your CSS file is being imported in your `./src/index.js` file:

```diff-js
  // src/index.js
  import React from 'react';
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
+ import './index.css';
  import App from './App';
  import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';

  ReactDOM.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
      <App />
    </React.StrictMode>,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );

  // ...
```

```preval finish
scripts:
  - npm run start
```
