# Using Tailwind CSS with Laravel

## Creating your project

Start by creating a new Laravel project if you don't have one set up already. The most common approach is to use the [Laravel Installer](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x#via-laravel-installer):

```shell
laravel new my-project
```

Next, install Laravel's front-end dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`:

```shell
npm install
```

## Setting up Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind using `npm` or `yarn`:

```shell
npm install tailwindcss
```

> Note that unlike many other build tools, Laravel Mix will always run autoprefixer for us automatically, so we don't need to install it or configure it ourselves.

Next, create a CSS file for your Tailwind styles and add a `@tailwind` directive for each of Tailwind's layers. We've stored in it `resources/css/tailwind.css` for this example:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Next, add your CSS file to your `webpack.mix.js` file and configure the `tailwindcss` PostCSS plugin using Mix's `postCss` method:

```js
mix
  .js("resources/js/app.js", "public/js")
  .postCss("resources/css/tailwind.css", "public/css", [
    require("tailwindcss"),
  ]);
```

Finally, import that CSS file into your main layout template:

```html
<!-- ... --->
<head>
  <!-- ... --->
  <link href="{{ asset('css/tailwind.css') }}" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>
<!-- ... --->
```

If you'd like to customize your Tailwind configuration, run `npx tailwindcss init` to create a `tailwind.config.js` file in your project root.
