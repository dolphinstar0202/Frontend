## Creating your project

Start by creating a new Laravel project if you don't have one set up already. The most common approach is to use the [Laravel Installer](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x#via-laravel-installer):

```shell
laravel new my-project
cd my-project
```

Next, install Laravel's front-end dependencies using `npm`:

```shell
npm install
```

## Setting up Tailwind CSS

### Install Tailwind via npm

Install Tailwind and its peer-dependencies using `npm`:

```shell
npm install -D tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9
```

Laravel Mix doesn't support PostCSS 8 yet *(but it's coming soon)* so you need to install [the Tailwind CSS v2.0 PostCSS 7 compatibility build](/docs/installation#post-css-7-compatibility-build) for now as we've shown above.

### Create your configuration file

Next, generate your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```shell
npx tailwindcss init
```

This will create a minimal `tailwind.config.js` file at the root of your project:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
```

Learn more about configuring Tailwind in the [configuration documentation](/docs/configuration).

### Configure Tailwind to remove unused styles in production

In your `tailwind.config.js` file, configure the `purge` option with the paths to all of your Blade templates and JavaScript components so Tailwind can tree-shake unused styles in production builds:

```diff-js
  // tailwind.config.js
  module.exports = {
-   purge: [],
+   purge: [
+     './resources/**/*.blade.php',
+     './resources/**/*.js',
+     './resources/**/*.vue',
+   ],
    darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
    theme: {
      extend: {}
    },
    variants: {},
    plugins: []
  }
```

Read our separate guide on [optimizing for production](/docs/optimizing-for-production) to learn more about tree-shaking unused styles for best performance.

### Configure Tailwind with Laravel Mix

In your `webpack.mix.js`, add `tailwindcss` as a PostCSS plugin:

```diff-js
  // webpack.mix.js
  mix.js("resources/js/app.js", "public/js")
    .postCss("resources/css/app.css", "public/css", [
+     require("tailwindcss"),
    ]);
```

### Include Tailwind in your CSS

Open the `./resources/css/app.css` file that Laravel generates for you by default and use the `@tailwind` directive to include Tailwind's `base`, `components`, and `utilities` styles.

```css
/* ./resources/css/app.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Tailwind will swap these directives out at build-time with all of the styles it generates based on your configured design system.

Read our documentation on [adding base styles](/docs/adding-base-styles), [extracting components](/docs/extracting-components), and [adding new utilities](/docs/adding-new-utilities) for best practices on extending Tailwind with your own custom CSS.

Next, import your stylesheet in your main Blade layout (commonly `resources/views/layouts/app.php` or similar) and add the responsive viewport meta tag if it's not already present:

```diff-html
  <!doctype html>
  <head>
    <!-- ... --->
+   <meta charset="UTF-8" />
+   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
+   <link href="{{ asset('css/app.css') }}" rel="stylesheet">
  </head>
  <!-- ... --->
```

You're finished! Now when you run `npm run watch`, `npm run dev`, or `npm run prod` to run Laravel Mix, Tailwind CSS will be ready to use in your project.
