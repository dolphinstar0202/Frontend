## Creating your project

Start by creating a new Nuxt.js project if you don't have one set up already using [`create-nuxt-app`](https://nuxtjs.org/guides/get-started/installation#using-create-nuxt-app):

```shell
npx create-nuxt-app my-project
```

**Do not choose "Tailwind CSS" when prompted to select your "UI Framework"**. This will cause conflicts that prevent you from being able to install Tailwind CSS v2.0 due to the `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss` module depending on an old version of Tailwind.

Next, change directories to your new project:

```shell
cd my-project
```

---

## Setting up Tailwind CSS

### Install Tailwind via npm

If you already have the `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss` module installed for any reason, it's important that you uninstall it before installing Tailwind itself:

```shell
npm uninstall @nuxtjs/tailwindcss tailwindcss
```

Next, install Tailwind and its peer-dependencies:

```shell
npm install -D tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9
```

Nuxt.js doesn't support PostCSS 8 yet so you need to install [the Tailwind CSS v2.0 PostCSS 7 compatibility build](/docs/installation#post-css-7-compatibility-build) for now as we've shown above.

Next, install the `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss` module:

```shell
npm install -D @nuxtjs/tailwindcss
```

Add the `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss` module to the `buildModules` section of your `nuxt.config.js` file:

```js
// nuxt.config.js
export default {
  buildModules: ['@nuxtjs/tailwindcss']
}
```

### Create your configuration file

Next, generate your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```shell
npx tailwindcss init
```

This will create a minimal `tailwind.config.js` file at the root of your project:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
```

Learn more about configuring Tailwind in the [configuration documentation](/docs/configuration).

### Configure Tailwind to remove unused styles in production

In your `tailwind.config.js` file, configure the `purge` option with the paths to all of your components so Tailwind can tree-shake unused styles in production builds:

```diff-js
  // tailwind.config.js
  module.exports = {
-   purge: [],
+   purge: [
+     './components/**/*.{vue,js}',
+     './layouts/**/*.vue',
+     './pages/**/*.vue',
+     './plugins/**/*.{js,ts}',
+     './nuxt.config.{js,ts}',
+   ],
    darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
    theme: {
      extend: {}
    },
    variants: {},
    plugins: []
  }
```

Read our separate guide on [optimizing for production](/docs/optimizing-for-production) to learn more about tree-shaking unused styles for best performance.

### Include Tailwind in your CSS

Create a new CSS file at `./assets/css/tailwind.css` file and use the `@tailwind` directive to include Tailwind's `base`, `components`, and `utilities` styles inside your main CSS file.

```css
/* ./src/index.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Tailwind will swap these directives out at build-time with all of the styles it generates based on your configured design system.

Read our documentation on [adding base styles](/docs/adding-base-styles), [extracting components](/docs/extracting-components), and [adding new utilities](/docs/adding-new-utilities) for best practices on extending Tailwind with your own custom CSS.

You're finished! Now when you run `npm run dev` to start the Nuxt.js development server, Tailwind CSS will be ready to use in your project.
