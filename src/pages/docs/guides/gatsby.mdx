## Creating your project

Start by creating a new Gatsby project if you don't have one set up already. The most common approach is to use [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start/#use-the-gatsby-cli):

```shell
gatsby new my-project
cd my-project
```

## Setting up Tailwind CSS

### Install Tailwind via npm

Install `gatsby-plugin-postcss` as well as Tailwind and its peer-dependencies using `npm`:

```shell
npm install gatsby-plugin-postcss tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

### Create your configuration files

Next, generate your `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files:

```shell
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

This will create a minimal `tailwind.config.js` file at the root of your project:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
```

Learn more about configuring Tailwind in the [configuration documentation](/docs/configuration).

It will also create a `postcss.config.js` file that includes `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` already configured:

```js
// postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  }
}
```

If you're planning to use any other PostCSS plugins, you should read our documentation on [using PostCSS as your preprocessor](/docs/using-with-preprocessors) for more details about the best way to order them alongside Tailwind.

### Enable gatsby-plugin-postcss 

In your `gatsby-config.js` file, enable the [postcss plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-postcss/)

```diff-js
  // gatsby-config.js
  module.exports = {
    /* Your site config here */
-   plugins: [],
+   plugins: [`gatsby-plugin-postcss`],
  }

```

### Configure Tailwind to remove unused styles in production

In your `tailwind.config.js` file, configure the `purge` option with the paths to all of your pages and components so Tailwind can tree-shake unused styles in production builds:

```diff-js
  // tailwind.config.js
  module.exports = {
-   purge: [],
+   purge: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
    darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
    theme: {
      extend: {}
    },
    variants: {},
    plugins: []
  }
```

Read our separate guide on [optimizing for production](/docs/optimizing-for-production) to learn more about tree-shaking unused styles for best performance.

### Include Tailwind in your CSS

Create a CSS file like `global.css` within a folder like `./src/styles`:

```shell
cd src
mkdir styles
cd styles
touch global.css
```

Then use the `@tailwind` directive to include Tailwind's `base`, `components`, and `utilities` styles:

```css
/* ./src/styles/global.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Tailwind will swap these directives out at build-time with all of the styles it generates based on your configured design system.

Read our documentation on [adding base styles](/docs/adding-base-styles), [extracting components](/docs/extracting-components), and [adding new utilities](/docs/adding-new-utilities) for best practices on extending Tailwind with your own custom CSS.

Finally, create a `./gatsby-browser.js` file at the root of your project if it doesn't already exist, and import your CSS file:

```diff-js
  // ./gatsby-browser.js
+ import './src/styles/global.css';
```

Read [the Gatsby documentation on using global styles](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-two/#using-global-styles) to learn more about working with global CSS files in Gatsby.

You're finished! Now when you run `gatsby develop` to start the Gatsby development server, Tailwind CSS will be ready to use in your project.
