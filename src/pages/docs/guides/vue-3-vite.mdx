## Creating your project

Start by creating a new Vite project if you don't have one set up already and installing its dependencies:

```shell
npx create-vite-app my-project
cd my-project
npm install
```

---

## Setting up Tailwind CSS

### Install Tailwind via npm

Install Tailwind and its peer-dependencies using `npm`:

```shell
npm install -D tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9
```

Vue 3 and Vite don't support PostCSS 8 yet so you need to install [the Tailwind CSS v2.0 PostCSS 7 compatibility build](/docs/installation#post-css-7-compatibility-build) for now as we've shown above.

### Create your configuration files

Next, generate your `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files:

```shell
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

This will create a minimal `tailwind.config.js` file at the root of your project:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
```

Learn more about configuring Tailwind in the [configuration documentation](/docs/configuration).

It will also create a `postcss.config.js` file that includes `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` already configured:

```js
// postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  }
}
```

If you're planning to use any other PostCSS plugins, you should read our documentation on [using PostCSS as your preprocessor](/docs/using-with-preprocessors) for more details about the best way to order them alongside Tailwind.

### Configure Tailwind to remove unused styles in production

In your `tailwind.config.js` file, configure the `purge` option with the paths to all of your components so Tailwind can tree-shake unused styles in production builds:

```diff-js
  // tailwind.config.js
  module.exports = {
-   purge: [],
+   purge: ['./src/**/*.{vue,js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
    darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
    theme: {
      extend: {}
    },
    variants: {},
    plugins: []
  }
```

Read our separate guide on [optimizing for production](/docs/optimizing-for-production) to learn more about tree-shaking unused styles for best performance.

### Include Tailwind in your CSS

Open the `./src/index.css` file that Vite generates for you by default and use the `@tailwind` directive to include Tailwind's `base`, `components`, and `utilities` styles:

```css
/* ./src/index.css */

/*! @import */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

<p><em>Due to <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1131113">a bug in Chromium</a>, it's important that you include the weird <code>/*! @import */</code> comment to avoid performance issues in Chrome DevTools during development. This is already fixed in Canary but hasn't been released generally yet.</em></p>

Tailwind will swap these directives out at build-time with all of the styles it generates based on your configured design system.

Read our documentation on [adding base styles](/docs/adding-base-styles), [extracting components](/docs/extracting-components), and [adding new utilities](/docs/adding-new-utilities) for best practices on extending Tailwind with your own custom CSS.

Finally, ensure your CSS file is being imported in your `./src/main.js` file:

```js
// src/main.js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import './index.css'

createApp(App).mount('#app')
```

---

You're finished! Now when you run `npm run dev` to start the Vite development server, Tailwind CSS will be ready to use in your project.
