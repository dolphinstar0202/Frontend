## Basic usage

### Clearing left-floated elements

Use `clear-left` to position an element below any preceding left-floated elements.

<Example resizable p="none">
  <div class="mx-4 bg-white shadow-xl p-8 text-slate-700 text-sm sm:text-base leading-6 sm:leading-7 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-slate-400">
    <div class="float-left mb-4 rounded-xl overflow-hidden">
      <div class="relative aspect-w-1 aspect-h-1 sm:aspect-w-16 sm:aspect-h-9 w-24 sm:w-44">
        <img class="object-cover" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1554629947-334ff61d85dc?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=320&q=80" />
        <div class="absolute inset-0 ring-1 ring-inset ring-black/10 rounded-xl"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="float-right ml-6 mb-4 rounded-xl overflow-hidden ">
      <div class="relative aspect-w-1 aspect-h-1 sm:aspect-w-16 sm:aspect-h-9 w-40 sm:w-64">
        <img class="object-cover" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1554629947-334ff61d85dc?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=320&q=80" />
        <div class="absolute inset-0 ring-1 ring-inset ring-black/10 rounded-xl"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="clear-left text-justify">Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies.</p>
  </div>
</Example>

```html
<img class="float-left ..." src="path/to/image.jpg">
<img class="float-right ..." src="path/to/image.jpg">
<p class="**clear-left** ...">Maybe we can live without libraries...</p>
```

### Clearing right-floated elements

Use `clear-right` to position an element below any preceding right-floated elements.

<Example resizable p="none">
  <div class="mx-4 bg-white shadow-xl p-8 text-slate-700 text-sm sm:text-base leading-6 sm:leading-7 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-slate-400">
    <div class="float-left mr-6 mb-4 rounded-xl overflow-hidden">
      <div class="relative aspect-w-4 aspect-h-5 sm:aspect-w-16 sm:aspect-h-9 w-28 sm:w-64">
        <img class="object-cover" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1554629947-334ff61d85dc?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=320&q=80" />
        <div class="absolute inset-0 ring-1 ring-inset ring-black/10 rounded-xl"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="float-right mb-4 rounded-xl overflow-hidden ">
      <div class="relative aspect-w-4 aspect-h-5 sm:aspect-w-16 sm:aspect-h-9 w-20 sm:w-44">
        <img class="object-cover" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1554629947-334ff61d85dc?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=320&q=80" />
        <div class="absolute inset-0 ring-1 ring-inset ring-black/10 rounded-xl"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="clear-right text-justify">Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers?

  </div>

<img class="float-left ..." src="path/to/image.jpg">
<img class="float-right ..." src="path/to/image.jpg">
<p class="**clear-right** ...">Maybe we can live without libraries...</p>
```

### Clearing all floated elements

Use `clear-both` to position an element below all preceding floated elements.

<Example resizable p="none">
  <div class="mx-4 bg-white shadow-xl p-8 text-slate-700 text-sm sm:text-base leading-6 sm:leading-7 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-slate-400">
    <div class="float-left mb-4 rounded-xl overflow-hidden">
      <div class="relative aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 w-44">
        <img class="object-cover" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1554629947-334ff61d85dc?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=320&q=80" />
        <div class="absolute inset-0 ring-1 ring-inset ring-black/10 rounded-xl"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="float-right ml-6 mb-4 rounded-xl overflow-hidden ">
      <div class="relative aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 w-64">
        <img class="object-cover" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1554629947-334ff61d85dc?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=320&q=80" />
        <div class="absolute inset-0 ring-1 ring-inset ring-black/10 rounded-xl"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="clear-both text-justify">Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped!

```html
<img class="float-left ..." src="path/to/image.jpg">
<img class="float-right ..." src="path/to/image.jpg">
<p class="**clear-both** ...">Maybe we can live without libraries...</p>
```

### Disabling applied clears

Use `clear-none` to reset any clears that are applied to an element. This is the default value for the clear property.

<Example resizable p="none">
  <div class="mx-4 bg-white shadow-xl p-8 text-slate-700 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-slate-400">
    <div class="relative float-left mr-6 mb-4 rounded-xl overflow-hidden">
      <div class="relative aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 w-44">
        <img class="h-24 object-cover" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1554629947-334ff61d85dc?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=320&q=80" />
        <div class="absolute inset-0 ring-1 ring-inset ring-black/10 rounded-xl"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="relative float-right ml-6 mb-4 rounded-xl overflow-hidden">
      <div class="relative aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 w-64">
        <img class="h-36 object-cover" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1554629947-334ff61d85dc?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=320&q=80" />
        <div class="absolute inset-0 ring-1 ring-inset ring-black/10 rounded-xl"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="clear-none text-justify">Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies.</p>
  </div>

<img class="float-left ..." src="path/to/image.jpg">
<img class="float-right ..." src="path/to/image.jpg">
<p class="**clear-none** ...">Maybe we can live without libraries...</p>
