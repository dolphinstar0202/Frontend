## Basic usage

### Floating elements to the right

Use `float-right` to float an element to the right of its container.

<Example resizable p="none">
  <div class="mx-4 bg-white shadow-xl p-8 text-slate-700 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-slate-400">
    <div class="float-right ml-6">
      <div class="relative aspect-w-4 aspect-h-5 sm:aspect-w-16 sm:aspect-h-9 w-20 sm:w-44">
        <img class="object-cover rounded-lg" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1554629947-334ff61d85dc?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=320&q=80" />
        <div class="absolute inset-0 ring-1 ring-inset ring-black/10 rounded-lg"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="text-justify">Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better?  Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies.</p>
  </div>
</Example>

```html
<img class="**float-right** ..." src="path/to/image.jpg">
<p>Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. ...</p>
```

### Floating elements to the left

Use `float-left` to float an element to the left of its container.

<Example resizable p="none">
  <div class="mx-4 bg-white shadow-xl p-8 text-slate-700 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-slate-400">
    <div class="float-left mr-6">
      <div class="relative aspect-w-4 aspect-h-5 sm:aspect-w-16 sm:aspect-h-9 w-20 sm:w-44">
        <img class="object-cover rounded-lg" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1554629947-334ff61d85dc?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=320&q=80" />
        <div class="absolute inset-0 ring-1 ring-inset ring-black/10 rounded-lg"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="text-justify">Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better?  Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies.</p>
  </div>
</Example>

```html
<img class="**float-left** ..." src="path/to/image.jpg">
<p>Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. ...</p>
```

### Disabling a float

Use `float-none` to reset any floats that are applied to an element. This is the default value for the float property.

<Example resizable p="none">
  <div class="mx-4 bg-white shadow-xl p-8 text-slate-700 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-slate-400">
    <div class="inline-block relative mb-4">
      <div class="relative aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 w-44">
        <img class="object-cover rounded-lg" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1554629947-334ff61d85dc?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=320&q=80" />
        <div class="absolute inset-0 ring-1 ring-inset ring-black/10 rounded-lg"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="text-justify">Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers?

  </div>
</Example>

```html
<img class="**float-none** ..." src="path/to/image.jpg">
<p>Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. ...</p>
```
