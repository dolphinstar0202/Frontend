_Work in progress_


A plugin that provides a set of `prose` classes you can use to add beautiful typographic defaults to any vanilla HTML you don't control (like HTML rendered from Markdown, or pulled from a CMS).

[View live demo](https://play.tailwindcss.com/uj1vGACRJA?layout=preview)

```html
<article class="prose lg:prose-xl">{{ markdown }}</article>
```

---

## Installation

Install the plugin from npm:

```shell
npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography
```

Then add the plugin to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    // ...
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
    // ...
  ],
}
```

---

## Basic usage

Now you can use the `prose` classes to add sensible typography styles to any vanilla HTML:

```html
<article class="prose lg:prose-xl">
  <h1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h1>
  <p>
    For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread with cheese to their
    children, with the food earning such an iconic status in our culture that kids will often dress
    up as warm, cheesy loaf for Halloween.
  </p>
  <p>
    But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a series of rabies cases
    springing up around the country.
  </p>

```

### Choosing a gray scale

Tailwind CSS includes five sets of grays out of the box, and this plugin includes a modifier class for each one so you can easily style your content to match the shades of gray you're using in your project.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html
<article class="prose prose-slate">
  {{ markdown }}
</article>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Here are the classes that are generated using a totally default Tailwind CSS v2.0 build:

| Class                    | Gray scale | Demo |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ---- |
| `prose-gray` _(default)_ | Gray       |      |
| `prose-slate`            | Slate      |      |
| `prose-zinc`             | Zinc       |      |
| `prose-neutral`          | Neutral    |      |
| `prose-stone`            | Stone      |      |

Theme modifiers are designed to be used with the [multi-class modifier pattern](http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/#component-modifiers) and **must be used in conjunction with the base `prose` class**:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html
<!-- Will not work -->
<article class="prose-stone">
  {{ markdown }}
</article>

<!-- Always add the `prose` class -->
<article class="prose prose-stone">
  {{ markdown }}
</article>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

To learn about creating your own themes, read the [low-level customization API](#customization) documentation.

### Applying a type scale

Size modifiers allow you to adjust the overall size of your typography for different contexts.

```html
<article class="prose prose-xl">{{ markdown }}</article>
```

Five different typography sizes are included out of the box:

| Class                    |  Body font size |
| ------------------------ | --------------: |
| `prose-sm`               | 0.875rem (14px) |
| `prose-base` _(default)_ |     1rem (16px) |
| `prose-lg`               | 1.125rem (18px) |
| `prose-xl`               |  1.25rem (20px) |
| `prose-2xl`              |   1.5rem (24px) |

Everything about the provided size modifiers has been hand-tuned to look as beautiful as possible, including the relationships between font sizes, heading spacing, code block padding, etc. Just like the Tailwind color palettes, none of these styles are based on naive mathematical formulas, and have been hand-crafted by professional designers.

Size modifiers are designed to be used with the [multi-class modifier pattern](http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/#component-modifiers) and **must be used in conjunction with the base `prose` class**:

```html
<!-- Will not work -->
<article class="prose-lg">{{ markdown }}</article>

<!-- Always add the `prose` class -->
<article class="prose prose-lg">{{ markdown }}</article>
```

#### Responsive variants

None of the sizes are automatically responsive, but responsive variants are provided for each size modifier so you can easily change the typography size at different breakpoints:

```html
<article class="prose prose-sm sm:prose lg:prose-lg xl:prose-xl">{{ markdown }}</article>
```

### Adapting to dark mode

Each default color theme includes a hand-designed dark mode version that you can trigger by adding the `prose-invert` class:

```html
<article class="prose dark:prose-invert">{{ markdown }}</article>
```


### Element modifiers

Use element modifiers to customize prose styles directly in your HTML:

```html
<article class="prose prose-img:rounded-xl prose-headings:underline prose-a:text-blue-600">
  {{ markdown }}
</article>
```

This makes it easy to do things like style links to match your brand, add a border radius to images, and tons more.

Here's a complete list of available element modifiers:

| Modifier                     | Target                       |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `prose-headings:{utility}`   | `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `th` |
| `prose-lead:{utility}`       | `[class~="lead"]`            |
| `prose-h1:{utility}`         | `h1`                         |
| `prose-h2:{utility}`         | `h2`                         |
| `prose-h3:{utility}`         | `h3`                         |
| `prose-h4:{utility}`         | `h4`                         |
| `prose-p:{utility}`          | `p`                          |
| `prose-a:{utility}`          | `a`                          |
| `prose-blockquote:{utility}` | `blockquote`                 |
| `prose-figure:{utility}`     | `figure`                     |
| `prose-figcaption:{utility}` | `figcaption`                 |
| `prose-strong:{utility}`     | `strong`                     |
| `prose-em:{utility}`         | `em`                         |
| `prose-code:{utility}`       | `code`                       |
| `prose-pre:{utility}`        | `pre`                        |
| `prose-ol:{utility}`         | `ol`                         |
| `prose-ul:{utility}`         | `ul`                         |
| `prose-li:{utility}`         | `li`                         |
| `prose-table:{utility}`      | `table`                      |
| `prose-thead:{utility}`      | `thead`                      |
| `prose-tr:{utility}`         | `tr`                         |
| `prose-th:{utility}`         | `th`                         |
| `prose-td:{utility}`         | `td`                         |
| `prose-img:{utility}`        | `img`                        |
| `prose-video:{utility}`      | `video`                      |
| `prose-hr:{utility}`         | `hr`                         |

When stacking these modifiers with other modifiers like `hover`, you most likely want the other modifier to come first:

```html
<article class="prose prose-a:text-blue-600 hover:prose-a:text-blue-500">{{ markdown }}</article>
```

Read the Tailwind CSS documentation on [ordering stacked modifiers](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#ordering-stacked-modifiers) to learn more.

### Overriding max-width

Each size modifier comes with a baked in `max-width` designed to keep the content as readable as possible. This isn't always what you want though, and sometimes you'll want the content to just fill the width of its container.

In those cases, all you need to do is add `max-w-none` to your content to override the embedded max-width:

```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-4">
  <div class="col-span-1">
    <!-- ... -->
  </div>
  <div class="col-span-3">
    <article class="prose max-w-none">{{ markdown }}</article>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Advanced topics

### Undoing typography styles


If you have a block of markup embedded in some content that shouldn't inherit the `prose` styles, use the `not-prose` class to sandbox it:

```html
<article class="prose">
  <h1>My Heading</h1>
  <p>...</p>

  <div class="not-prose">
    <!-- Some example or demo that needs to be prose-free -->
  </div>

  <p>...</p>
  <!-- ... -->
</article>
```

Note that you can't nest new `prose` instances within a `not-prose` block at this time.

### Adding custom color themes

You can add a new modifier by creating a new key in the `typography` section of your theme and providing your own styles under the `css` key:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      typography: {
        '3xl': {
          css: {
            fontSize: '1.875rem',
            h1: {
              fontSize: '4rem',
            },
            // ...
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
    // ...
  ],
}
```

See our internal [style definitions](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography/blob/master/src/styles.js) for some examples of what these can look like in detail.

### Changing the default class name

If you need to use a class name other than `prose` for any reason, you can do so using the `className` option when registering the plugin:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    // ...
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography')({
        className: 'markdown',
    }),
  ]
  ...
}
```

```html
<article class="markdown md:markdown-lg">{{ markdown }}</article>
```

### Customizing the CSS

> The customization API is currently extremely low-level in order to be as flexible as possible. We will be introducing higher-level configuration options over time as we learn what types of customizations are most common.

To customize the styles provided by this plugin, add your overrides under the `typography` key in the `theme` section of your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      typography: {
        DEFAULT: {
          css: {
            color: '#333',
            a: {
              color: '#3182ce',
              '&:hover': {
                color: '#2c5282',
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
    // ...
  ],
}
```

Like with all theme customizations in Tailwind, you can also define the `typography` key as a function if you need access to the `theme` helper:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      typography: (theme) => ({
        DEFAULT: {
          css: {
            color: theme('colors.gray.800'),

            // ...
          },
        },
      }),
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
    // ...
  ],
}
```

Customizations should be applied to a specific modifier like `DEFAULT` or `xl`, and must be added under the `css` property. Customizations are authored in the same [CSS-in-JS syntax](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins#css-in-js-syntax) used to write Tailwind plugins.

It's important to note that all customizations are **merged** with the defaults. If you'd like to completely override a provided size modifier, you can do so by disabling that modifier so the default styles are not included.

See [the default styles](./src/styles.js) for this plugin for more in-depth examples of configuring each modifier.

#### Customizing shared styles

Many styles _(for example colors, font weight, and text decoration)_ are shared between all size modifiers, and are therefore defined only for the `DEFAULT` modifier, since modifiers are designed to be used with the [multi-class modifier pattern](http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/#component-modifiers).

If you'd like to customize these sorts of styles, do so using the `DEFAULT` modifier:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      typography: {
        DEFAULT: {
          css: {
            color: '#333',
            strong: {
              fontWeight: '800',
            },
            // ...
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
    // ...
  ],
}
```
