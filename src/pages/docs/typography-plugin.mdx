The [@tailwindcss/typography plugin](https://github.com/tailwindcss/typography) adds a set of customizable `prose` classes that you can use to add beautiful typographic defaults to any vanilla HTML, like the output you'd get after parsing some Markdown, or content you pull from a CMS.

  <h1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h1>
  <p>
    For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread with cheese to their
    children, with the food earning such an iconic status in our culture that kids will often dress
    up as warm, cheesy loaf for Halloween.

    springing up around the country.

It provides sensible defaults for everything you might expect like:

- Basic typography
- Heading styles
- Tables
- Ordered and unordered lists
- Horizontal rules
- ...and more
