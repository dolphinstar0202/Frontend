Tailwind CSS v2.1 introduces a new just-in-time compiler for Tailwind CSS that generates your styles on-demand as you author your templates instead of generating everything in advance at initial build time.

<div className="relative pb-[calc(9/16*100%)] my-12">
  <iframe
    className="absolute inset-0 h-full w-full"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3O_3X7InOw8"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

This comes with a lot of advantages:

- **Lightning fast build times**. Tailwind can take 3–8s to initially compile using our CLI, and upwards of 30–45s in webpack projects because webpack struggles with large CSS files. This library can compile even the biggest projects in about 800ms _(with incremental rebuilds as fast as 3ms)_, no matter what build tool you're using.
- **Every variant is enabled out of the box**. Variants like `focus-visible`, `active`, `disabled`, and others are not normally enabled by default due to file-size considerations. Since this library generates styles on demand, you can use any variant you want, whenever you want. You can even stack them like `sm:hover:active:disabled:opacity-75`. Never configure your variants again.
- **Generate arbitrary styles without writing custom CSS.** Ever needed some ultra-specific value that wasn't part of your design system, like `top: -113px` for a quirky background image? Since styles are generated on demand, you can just generate a utility for this as needed using square bracket notation like `top-[-113px]`. Works with variants too, like `md:top-[-113px]`.
- **Your CSS is identical in development and production**. Since styles are generated as they are needed, you don't need to purge unused styles for production, which means you see the exact same CSS in all environments. Never worry about accidentally purging an important style in production again.
- **Better browser performance in development**. Since development builds are as small as production builds, the browser doesn't have to parse and manage multiple megabytes of pre-generated CSS. In projects with heavily extended configurations this makes dev tools a lot more responsive.

## Enabling JIT mode

To enable just-in-time mode, set the `mode` option to `'jit'` in your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```diff-js
  // tailwind.config.js
  module.exports = {
+   mode: 'jit',
    purge: [
      // ...
    ],
    theme: {
      // ...
    }
    // ...
  }
```

Since JIT mode generates your CSS on-demand by scanning your template files, it's crucial that you configure the `purge` option in your `tailwind.config.js` file with all of your template paths, otherwise your CSS will be empty:

```diff-js
  // tailwind.config.js
  module.exports = {
    mode: 'jit',
+   // These paths are just examples, customize them to match your project structure
+   purge: [
+     './public/**/*.html',
+     './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,vue}',
+   ],
    theme: {
      // ...
    }
    // ...
  }
```

Now when you start your development server or build runner, Tailwind will generate your styles on-demand instead of generating everything in advance.

## New features

### All variants are enabled

Since styles are generated on-demand, there's no need to configure which variants are available for each core plugin.

```html
<input class="disabled:opacity-75">
```

You can use variants like `focus-visible`, `active`, `disabled`, `even`, and more in combination with any utility, without making any changes to your `tailwind.config.js` file.

### Stackable variants

All variants can be combined together to easily target very specific situations without writing custom CSS.

```html
<button class="md:dark:disabled:focus:hover:bg-gray-400">
```

### Arbitrary value support

Many utilities support arbitrary values using a new square bracket notation to indicate that you're "breaking out" of your design system.

```html
<!-- Sizes and positioning -->
<img class="absolute w-[762px] h-[918px] top-[-325px] right-[62px] md:top-[-400px] md:right-[80px]" src="/crazy-background-image.png">

<!-- Colors -->
<button class="bg-[#1da1f1]">Share on Twitter</button>

<!-- Complex grids -->
<div class="grid-cols-[1fr,700px,2fr]">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

This is very useful for building pixel-perfect designs where there are a few elements that need hyper-specific styles, like a carefully positioned background image on a marketing site.

We'll likely add some form of "strict mode" in the future for power-hungry team leads who don't trust their colleagues to use this feature responsibly.

#### Dynamic values

Note that you still need to [write purgeable HTML](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production#writing-purgeable-html) when using arbitrary values, and your classes need to exist as complete strings for Tailwind to detect them correctly.

<TipBad>Don't use string concatenation to create class names</TipBad>

```jsx mt-4
<div className={`mt-[${size === 'lg' ? '22px' : '17px' }]`}></div>
```

<TipGood>Do dynamically select a complete class name</TipGood>

```jsx mt-4
<div className={ size === 'lg' ? 'mt-[22px]' : 'mt-[17px]' }></div>
```

Tailwind doesn't include any sort of client-side runtime, so class names need to be statically extractable at build-time, and can't depend on any sort of arbitrary dynamic values that change on the client. Use inline styles for these situations, or combine Tailwind with a CSS-in-JS library like [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) if it makes sense for your project.

<TipBad>Arbitrary values cannot be computed from dynamic values</TipBad>

```html mt-4
<div class="bg-[{{ userThemeColor }}]"></div>
```

<TipGood>Use inline styles for truly dynamic or user-defined values</TipGood>

```html mt-4
<div style="background-color: {{ userThemeColor }}"></div>
```

#### Values with spaces

It's also important to note that CSS classes cannot contain spaces, which means you can't use arbitrary values like `calc(100px - 4rem)` or `1fr 700px 2fr` as-is. To use arbitrary values like this in your class names, you need to remove the spaces in things like `calc` calls, and replace the spaces with commas in lists like `1fr 700px 2fr`. Tailwind will automatically re-introduce the spaces for you in `calc` calls and replace the commas with spaces in lists when generating the corresponding CSS.

<TipBad>Don't use spaces in arbitrary values</TipBad>

```html mt-4
<div class="h-[calc(1000px - 4rem)">...</div>
<div class="grid-cols-[1fr 700px 2fr]">...</div>
```

<TipGood>Remove spaces or replace with commas as appropriate</TipGood>

```html mt-4
<div class="h-[calc(1000px-4rem)]">...</div>
<div class="grid-cols-[1fr,700px,2fr]">...</div>
```

#### Ambiguous values

If you are using a CSS variable as an arbitrary value, it can sometimes lead to class names that are ambiguous to the engine, for example:

```html
<!-- Is this a font size utility, or a text color utility? -->
<div class="text-[var(--mystery-var)">
```

In these situations, you can provide a hint to the engine by prefixing the arbitrary value with the type name:

```html
<div class="text-[**color:**var(--mystery-var)">
```

The supported types are:

- `length`
- `color`
- `angle`
- `list`

### Built-in important modifier

You can make any utility important by adding a `!` character to the beginning:

```html
<p class="font-bold !font-medium">
  This will be medium even though bold comes later in the CSS.
</p>
```

The `!` always goes at the beginning of the utility name, after any variants, but before any prefix:

```html
<div class="sm:hover:!tw-font-bold">
```

This can be useful in rare situations where you need to increase specificity because you're at war with some styles you don't control.

### Per-side border colors

Requested since like 2017 but left out due to file-size considerations, the JIT engine finally adds support for setting the border color for each side of an element independently:

```html
<div class="border-2 border-t-blue-500 border-r-pink-500 border-b-green-500 border-l-yellow-500">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

### Pseudo-element variants

The JIT engine adds support for styling pseudo-elements like `::before`, `::after`, `::first-letter`, `::first-line`, `::marker`, and `::selection`.

```html
<div class="before:block before:bg-blue-500 after:flex after:bg-pink-300">
```

When you add any `before` or `after` variant, the `content` property is automatically set to `""` to make sure the element is actually visible. To change the content property, use the new [content utilities](#content-utilities).

As mentioned, we've also added support for other pseudo-elements like `::selection`, which allows you to style selected text:

```html
<p class="selection:bg-yellow-300 ...">
  I'm yellow when you highlight me.
</p>
```

Or the `::marker` pseudo-element, which allows you to style list markers:

```html
<ul class="marker:text-gray-500">
  <li>Odio et sed.</li>
  <li>Voluptatem perferendis optio est id.</li>
  <li>Accusamus et aut odit.</li>
</ul>
```

## Breaking changes

## Known limitations

This new engine is very close to feature parity with `tailwindcss` currently and for most projects I bet you'll find it works exactly as you'd expect.

There are a few items still on our todo list though that we are actively working on:

- Advanced PurgeCSS options like `safelist` aren't supported yet since we aren't actually using PurgeCSS. We'll add a way to safelist classes for sure though. For now, a `safelist.txt` file somewhere in your project with all the classes you want to safelist will work fine.
- You can only `@apply` classes that are part of core, generated by plugins, or defined within a `@layer` rule. You can't `@apply` arbitrary CSS classes that aren't defined within a `@layer` rule.

We are also ironing out some compatibility issues with certain build tools like Parcel and Snowpack, which you can follow in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues).

If you run into any other issues or find any bugs, please [open an issue](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/new/choose) so we can fix it.

## Troubleshooting

### Styles not updating when saving content files

As of Tailwind CSS v2.2+, the JIT engine depends on PostCSS's [directory dependency messages](https://github.com/postcss/postcss/blob/main/docs/guidelines/runner.md#3-dependencies) to register your content files as CSS build dependencies with your build tool. These are a fairly new addition to PostCSS (added in May 2021), and not all build tools have been updated to support them yet.

If your CSS isn't rebuilding when you change your content files, try setting `TAILWIND_MODE=watch` as part of your watch script to tell Tailwind to use a legacy dependency tracking strategy instead, which works well with many build tools.

For example, if you are using Vite, update your `dev` script to set `TAILWIND_MODE=watch` when it runs:

```js
// package.json
{
  // ...
  scripts: {
    // Set TAILWIND_MODE=watch when starting your dev server
    "dev": "TAILWIND_MODE=watch vite",

    // Do not set TAILWIND_MODE for one-off builds
    "build": "vite build",
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
```

Note that setting `TAILWIND_MODE=watch` will start a long-running watch process in the background, so if you set that environment variable when trying to do a one-off build, it will look like the build is hanging. You should only set `TAILWIND_MODE=watch` when you are actually running a dev server/watch process.

Tools that are known to require this option currently include:

- postcss-cli ([#383](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-cli/pull/383))
- Vite ([#3716](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/3716), [#3717](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/3717))
