title: Adding Base Styles
description: Best practices for adding your own global base styles on top of Tailwind.
---

Base (or global) styles are the styles at the beginning of a stylesheet that set useful defaults for basic HTML elements like `<a>` tags, headings, etc. or apply opinionated resets like the popular [box-sizing reset](https://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/).

Tailwind includes a useful set of base styles out of the box that we call [Preflight](/docs/preflight), which is really just [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) plus a thin layer of additional more opinionated styles.

Preflight is a great starting point for most projects, but if you'd ever like to add your own additional base styles, here are some recommendations for doing it idiomatically.

## Using classes in your HTML

If you just want to apply some global styling to the `html` or `body` elements, consider just adding existing classes to those elements in your HTML instead of writing new CSS:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en" class="text-gray-900 antialiased leading-tight">
  <!-- ... -->
  <body class="min-h-screen bg-gray-100">
    <!-- ... -->
  </body>
</html>
```

## Using CSS

If you want to apply some base styles to specific elements, the easiest way is to simply add them in your CSS.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer base {
  h1 {
    @apply text-2xl;
  }
  h2 {
    @apply text-xl;
  }
}
```

By using the `@layer` directive, Tailwind will automatically move those styles to the same place as `@tailwind base` to avoid unintended specificity issues.

Using the `@layer` directive will also instruct Tailwind to consider those styles for purging when purging the `base` layer. Read our [Controlling File Size](/docs/controlling-file-size) documentation for more details.

It's a good idea to use [@apply](/docs/functions-and-directives#apply) or [theme()](/docs/functions-and-directives#theme) to define these styles to avoid introducing new magic values or accidentally deviating from your design system.

### @font-face rules

You can use the same approach to add your `@font-face` rules for any custom fonts you are using:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer base {
  @font-face {
    font-family: Proxima Nova;
    font-weight: 400;
    src: url(/fonts/proxima-nova/400-regular.woff) format("woff");
  }
  @font-face {
    font-family: Proxima Nova;
    font-weight: 500;
    src: url(/fonts/proxima-nova/500-medium.woff) format("woff");
  }
}
```

## Using a plugin

You can also add base styles by [writing a plugin](/docs/plugins#adding-base-styles) and using the `addBase` function:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
const plugin = require('tailwindcss/plugin')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    plugin(function({ addBase, config }) {
      addBase({
        'h1': { fontSize: config('theme.fontSize.2xl') },
        'h2': { fontSize: config('theme.fontSize.xl') },
        'h3': { fontSize: config('theme.fontSize.lg') },
      })
    })
  ]
}
```

Any styles you added using `addBase` will automatically be included in your `@tailwind base` styles.

### When to use a plugin

In general, it's simpler to add base styles to your project in CSS than it is to write a plugin.

You should prefer a plugin if:

- You want to publish your base styles publicly and make them easy for other users to install.
- You want to re-use your base styles across multiple projects in your company and prefer sharing JS dependencies instead of CSS dependencies.
