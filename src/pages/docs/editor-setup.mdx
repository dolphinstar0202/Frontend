## Syntax support

Tailwind CSS uses a lot of custom CSS at-rules like `@tailwind`, `@apply`, and `@screen`, and in many editors this can trigger warnings or errors where these rules aren't recognized.

The solution to this is almost always to install a plugin for your editor/IDE for PostCSS language support instead of regular CSS. For example, VS Code has a [PostCSS Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=csstools.postcss) plugin you can use that works great with Tailwind CSS.

In some cases, you may need to disable native CSS linting/validations if your editor is very strict about the syntax it expects in your CSS files.


## IntelliSense for VS Code

The official [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) extension for Visual Studio Code enhances the Tailwind development experience by providing users with advanced features such as autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting.

- **Autocomplete**. Intelligent suggestions for class names, as well as [CSS functions and directives](/docs/functions-and-directives).
- **Linting**. Highlights errors and potential bugs in both your CSS and your markup.
- **Hover Previews**. See the complete CSS for a Tailwind class name by hovering over it.
- **Syntax Highlighting**. Provides syntax definitions so that Tailwind features are highlighted correctly.

Check out the project [on GitHub](https://github.com/tailwindcss/intellisense) to learn more, or [add it to Visual Studio Code](vscode:extension/bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) to get started now.

## JetBrains IDEs

JetBrains IDEs like WebStorm, PhpStorm, and others include support for intelligent Tailwind CSS completions in your HTML and when using `@apply`.
