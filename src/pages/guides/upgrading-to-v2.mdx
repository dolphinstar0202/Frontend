Tailwind CSS v2.0 is the first new major version since v1.0 was released in May 2019, and as such it includes a small number of breaking changes.

We don't take breaking changes lightly and have worked hard to make sure the upgrade path is as simple as possible. For most projects, upgrading should take less than 30 minutes.

----

## Support for IE 11 has been dropped

Prior to v2.0, we tried our best to make sure features we included in Tailwind worked in IE 11 whenever possible. This added considerable maintenance burden as well as increased build sizes (even when purging unused styles), so we have decided to drop support for IE 11 as of v2.0.

If you need to support IE 11, we recommend continuing to use Tailwind CSS v1.9 until you no longer need to support IE.

## Upgrade to Node.js 12.13 or higher

Tailwind CSS v2.0 no longer supports Node.js 8 or 10. To build your CSS you'll need to ensure you are running Node.js 12.13.0 or higher in both your local and CI environments.

## Update renamed utility classes

A small number of utilities have been renamed in v2.0:

| Old name             | New name            |
| -------------------- | ------------------- |
| `whitespace-no-wrap` | `whitespace-nowrap` |
| `flex-no-wrap`       | `flex-nowrap`       |
| `col-gap-{n}`        | `gap-x-{n}`         |
| `row-gap-{n}`        | `gap-y-{n}`         |

You should be able to globally find and replace these classes throughout your entire project very safely, as they are very distinct strings.

Updating `whitespace-no-wrap` and `flex-no-wrap` is just a direct replacement, and for the gap utilities we recommend replacing `col-gap-` with `gap-x-` and `row-gap-` with `gap-y-` to handle all sizes at once.

## Configure your color palette explicitly

**If you are already using a custom color palette, no changes are required and you can safely skip this step.**

The default color palette has changed considerably in Tailwind CSS v2.0 and is not designed to be a drop-in replacement for the color palette that was included in v1.

If you are implicitly relying on the default color palette, you should configure your color palette explicitly to override the new default palette with the colors your site is already using.

Here is an example `tailwind.config.js` file that includes the default colors from v1:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    colors: {
      transparent: 'transparent',
      current: 'currentColor',

      black: '#000',
      white: '#fff',

      gray: {
        100: '#f7fafc',

        900: '#702459',
      },
    }
  }
}
```

**We do not recommend updating existing sites to use the new default color palette.** The numbers are not meant to be transferrable, so for example `bg-red-600` in v2 is not just a "better" version of `bg-red-600` from v1 â€” it has different contrast characteristics. If you are happy with how your site looks, there is no reason to spend hours of your life updating your HTML. The old colors are great too!

## Configure your font-size scale explicitly

**If you are already using a custom typography scale, no changes are required and you can safely skip this step.**

In v2.0, each font-size utility includes a sensible size-specific line-height by default, so for example `text-sm` automatically sets a line-height of `1.25rem`.

This will change how your site looks anywhere where you haven't explicitly added a `leading` utility alongside a font-size utility.

The fastest way to get past this is to explicitly configure your font-size scale to use the scale from v1:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    fontSize: {
      xs: '0.75rem',
      sm: '0.875rem',
      base: '1rem',
      lg: '1.125rem',
      xl: '1.25rem',
      '2xl': '1.5rem',
      '3xl': '1.875rem',
      '4xl': '2.25rem',
      '5xl': '3rem',
      '6xl': '4rem',
    },
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can go through your HTML and explicitly add a `leading` utility anywhere where you were depending on an inherited line-height:

```diff
- <p class="text-lg">...</p>
+ <p class="text-lg leading-normal">...</p>
```

## Move deliberately shallow `extends` overrides to top-level

In Tailwind CSS v1.0, theme changes under `extends` were merged shallowly. So this configuration would override _all_ of the purple colors:

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extends: {
      colors: {
        purple: {
          light: '#E9D8FD',
          medium: '#9F7AEA',
          dark: '#553C9A',
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In v2.0, these are merged deeply, so the above configuration would still generate the default `purple-100` to `purple-900` shades in addition to the custom `purple-light`, `purple-medium`, and `purple-dark` shades.

For the most part this is just helpful, but if you were depending on the shallow merging you will want to move your customizations to the top-level, and manually merge in the other top-level colors:

```js
const defaultTheme = require('tailwindcss/defaultTheme')

module.exports = {
  theme: {
    colors: {
      ...defaultTheme.colors,
      purple: {
        light: '#E9D8FD',
        medium: '#9F7AEA',
        dark: '#553C9A',
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You probably won't have to do this.


## Update `@apply` statements that rely on class order

The `@apply` feature has gotten a lot more powerful in v2.0, but a few behaviors needed to change to make that possible.

Previously, classes were applied in the order they appeared in your CSS:

```css
/* Input */
.my-class {
  @apply pt-5 p-4;
}

/* Output */
.my-class {
  padding-top: 1.25rem;
  padding: 1rem;
}
```

Now, classes are applied in the order they appear in the original CSS:

```css
/* Input */
.my-class {
  @apply pt-5 p-4;
}

/* Output */
.my-class {
  padding: 1rem;
  padding-top: 1.25rem;
}
```

This is to make sure the behavior matches the behavior you'd get in HTML:

```html
<!-- Here `pt-5` still takes precedence even though it appears first. -->
<div class="pt-5 p-4">...</div>
```

If you were depending on the old behavior, you may see some differences in how your site is rendered. To get around this, use multiple `@apply` declarations:

```css
.my-class {
  @apply pt-5;
  @apply p-4;
}
```

This is unlikely to affect almost anyone who wasn't going out their way to do something weird.

## Add your configured prefix to any `@apply` statements

In Tailwind CSS v1.0, you could `@apply` unprefixed utilities even if you had configured a prefix.

This is no longer supported in v2.0, so if you have a prefix (like `tw-`) configured for your site, you'll need to make sure you include that whenever you use `@apply`:

```css
.my-class {
  @apply tw-p-4 tw-bg-red-500;
}
```

## Removing leading `.` from `@apply` statements

We used to support writing `@apply` statements with an optional leading `.` character:

```css
.my-class {
  @apply .p-4 .bg-red-500;
}
```

We don't support this anymore, so update any `@apply` statements and remove the dot:

```css
.my-class {
  @apply p-4 bg-red-500;
}
```

## Enable any `truncate` variants under `textOverflow`

The `truncate` utility is now part of the `textOverflow` core plugin, so if you had enabled any extra variants (like `group-hover`) for the `wordBreak` plugin in order to use them with the `truncate` class, you'll want to enable them for `textOverflow` now as well or instead:

```diff
  // tailwind.config.js
  module.exports = {
    variants: {
      wordBreak: ['responsive', 'group-hover'],
+     textOverflow: ['responsive', 'group-hover'],
    }
  }
```

## `scrolling-touch` and `scrolling-auto` have been removed

Since iOS 13 stopped supporting the `-webkit-overflow-scrolling` property, we've removed these two utilities from v2.0.

If you still need them because you are building something for older iOS versions, you can add them yourself as custom utilities:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer utilities {
  @responsive {
    .scrolling-touch {
      -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
    }
    .scrolling-auto {
      -webkit-overflow-scrolling: auto;
    }
  }
}
```

## Update `theme` function references that read from arrays

The `theme` function (in CSS, the `tailwind.config.js` file, and in the plugin API) is more intelligent in v2.0 and no longer requires you to manually join arrays or access the first index explicitly.

```js
// tailwind.config.js
const plugin = require('tailwindcss/plugin')

module.exports = {
  theme: {
    fontSize: {
      // ...
      xl: ['20px', { lineHeight: '28px' }]
    }
  },
  plugins: [
    plugin(({ addBase, theme }) => {
      addBase({
        h1: {
          // Before
          fontSize: theme('fontSize.xl')[0],
          fontFamily: theme('fontFamily.sans').join(','),

          // Now
          fontSize: theme('fontSize.xl'),
          fontFamily: theme('fontFamily.sans'),
        }
      })
    })
  ]
}
```

If for whatever reason you want to access the raw data structure, you can use the `config` function instead.

## Add `hidden` to any `template` tags within `space` or `divide` elements

We used to have a special rule for ignoring `template` elements when using the `space-x/y` and `divide-x/y` utilities, mostly to make life easier for Alpine.js users.

We've updated how this works to no longer special case `template` elements and instead just explicitly ignore any element that has a `hidden` attribute.

To update your code for this change, just add `hidden` to your `template` tags:

```diff
  <div class="space-y-4">
-   <template x-for="item in items">
+   <template x-for="item in items" hidden>
      <!-- ... -->
    </template>
  </div>
```

## Update purge `options` to match PurgeCSS 3.0

Internally we've upgraded to [PurgeCSS 3.0](https://github.com/FullHuman/purgecss/releases/tag/v3.0.0), so any raw options you were passing into PurgeCSS through the `options` key need to be updated to match the options exposed in PurgeCSS 3.0.

For example, if you were using `whitelist`, you'll want to update this to `safelist`:

```diff
  // tailwind.config.js
  module.exports = {
    purge: {
      content: [
        // ...
      ],
      options: {
-       whitelist: ['my-class']
+       safelist: ['my-class']
      }
    }
  }
```

If you weren't using the `options` key, you don't need to do anything.

## Disable `preserveHtmlElements` if using a custom PurgeCSS extractor

In v1.0, Tailwind ignored the `preserveHtmlElements` option if you were using a custom extractor. This option is now properly respected in v2.0, so if you want to disable it you'll need to do so explicitly:

```diff
  // tailwind.config.js
  module.exports = {
    purge: {
      content: [
        // ...
      ],
+     preserveHtmlElements: false,
      options: {
        defaultExtractor: () => {
          // ...
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

## Prefix any keyframe references if needed

If you've configured a prefix in your `tailwind.config.js` file, Tailwind v2.0 will automatically apply that prefix to any keyframes declarations in your `theme`.

If you are referencing any configured keyframes in custom CSS, you'll want to make sure you add your prefix:

```diff
  .my-class {
-   animation: spin 1s infinite;
+   animation: tw-spin 1s infinite;
  }
```

This only matters if you've configured a prefix _and_ you're referencing configured keyframes in custom CSS files. If this affects more than two people on the entire planet I will be absolutely amazed.

## Upgrading

<!-- - Update your build environment to a modern version of Node -->
<!-- - Tell any customers who use IE11 to get with the times -->
<!-- - Don't depend on default colors -->
<!-- - `@apply` is based on CSS order, not class list order -->
<!-- - You can't use `@apply` without a prefix if you have configured a prefix -->
<!-- - Override the `fontSize` config or add line-height utilities to your templates to override the new default line-height values per font-size -->
<!-- - Add any extra variants you need for `truncate` to the `textOverflow` plugin -->
<!-- - Remove `scrolling-touch` and `scrolling-auto` from your HTML, they don't do anything -->
<!-- - Rename `whitespace-no-wrap`, `flex-no-wrap`, and `col/row-gap` utilities -->
<!-- - Update use of `theme` to be less data structure aware -->
<!-- - Add `hidden` to any `template` elements that are within `space` or `divide` blocks -->
<!-- - Disable `preserveHtmlElements` if you're using a custom extractor and don't want it respected -->
<!-- - Keyframes are prefixed automatically if you have a prefix in your config, make sure any custom CSS referencing those keyframe names accounts for this -->
<!-- - If you were relying on `extends` only merging shallowly, you will have to move those customizations out of `extends` -->
- Talk about upgrading custom forms and typography plugins?
