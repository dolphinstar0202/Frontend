Almost 6 months in the making, we finally released [Tailwind UI Ecommerce](https://tailwindui.com/#product-ecommerce) — the first all-new component kit for Tailwind UI since the initial launch back in February 2020.

<!--/excerpt-->

Almost 6 months in the making, we finally released the first all-new component kit for [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com) since the initial launch back in February 2020!

[Tailwind UI Ecommerce](https://tailwindui.com/#product-ecommerce) adds over 100 new components across 14 new component categories and 7 new page example categories, including stuff like:

- Product Overviews
- Product Lists
- Category Previews
- Shopping Carts
- Category Filters
- Product Quickviews
- Store Navigation
- Promo Sections
- Checkout Forms
- Customer Reviews
- Order Summaries
- Storefront Pages
- Product Pages
- Order History Pages

...and more.

For a quick preview, check out this product page example we shared via our newsletter last week:

It's been a really fun and challenging process putting this together, and I'm really proud of how it turned out. I wrote up a big post about ["Designing Tailwind UI Ecommerce"](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/designing-tailwind-ui-ecommerce) that's worth a read if you're interested in the process behind putting together a new Tailwind UI product like this.

You can check out a bunch more interactive previews as well as screenshots of every single new example over at [the Tailwind UI website](https://tailwindui.com/#product-ecommerce).

If you like what you see, consider [purchasing a license](https://tailwindui.com/pricing) — it's the best way to support our work on Tailwind CSS and Headless UI and makes it possible for us to keep making these tools better and better.
