Last month, over 200 people got together in my hometown of Cambridge, Ontario to hang out, talk shop, and get a peek behind the curtain at some of the new stuff we've been working on.

Tailwind Connect started out as an idea for just throwing a little local meetup while we had the team in town for a retreat, but naturally ballooned into us renting a massive hall, hiring a crew of four videographers, and racking up a catering bill that put my own wedding to shame.
