## Cleaning up unnecessary whitespace

When you're copying around class names or deleting a class name from the middle of a list, it's easy to end up with some extra whitespace that needs to be cleaned up.

Now our Prettier plugin will handle this for you automatically, so you don't need to clean it up yourself.

## Removing duplicate classes

Our [VS Code extension](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup#intelli-sense-for-vs-code) has warned you about duplicate class names for a long time, but now our Prettier plugin can remove those duplicate classes for you automatically.

To start playing with these improvements in your own projects, just install the latest version:

```sh
$ npm i prettier-plugin-tailwindcss@latest
```
