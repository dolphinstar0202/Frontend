- Pocket template
- Start with quick overview, highlighting some cool stuff
- Screenshot from website
- Talk about the process of building it, how it started off pretty static but something about it didn't quite feel "real" when we put it in the browser, didn't have a unique hook
- Added a bunch of animations
- Dropped the static screenshots for a mobile UI built with HTML and CSS, harder to swap but felt like the right trade-off because that's what we'd really do in our own stuff
- Include link to an old deployment from before we added all the cool stuff
