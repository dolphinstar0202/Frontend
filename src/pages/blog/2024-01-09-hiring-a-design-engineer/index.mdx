We're hiring an experienced **Design Engineer** to help us design and develop new features and products, elevate and evolve our brand, and invent new ways to help developers build interfaces they can be proud of.

This is a fully remote position with a salary range of $275,000 – $325,000 USD, and is open to candidates in the Eastern (UTC-5) to Central European (UTC+1) timezones.


## Todo

- Sell the role, talk about working alongside me and Steve
- Talk about having considerable ownership over things like new template direction, trying to do more than one project at a time
- Include videos like our Protocol template stuff even? Make the post splashy

## What you'll work on

Recent:

- Designing and building the first components for Catalyst, our new React UI kit
- Designing and building the Tailwind Connect microsite
- Build the Studio template
- Add TypeScript support to all of our templates


Soon:

- Redesign the Headless UI documentation site for our upcoming v2.0 release
- Build the next version of tailwindcss.com, including new interactive demos, etc.
- Design a microsite for the next Tailwind CSS minor version release
- Build an internal tool we can use to design a new Tailwind CSS color palette using wide gamut colors
- Designing a `text-shadow` scale for a future Tailwind CSS release
- Turning an interesting thing you built into a great Twitter thread, teaching our audience how you did it
- Creating promotional assets for new releases, like social media cards, video trailers, and more
- Coming up with a concept for a new template that our customers will be excited about


## Who you are

- You love to teach
- Strong understanding of semantic markup and accessibility
- Experienced building UIs with React and Tailwind CSS
- Energized by the challenge of learning something new (figure out After Effects or Apple Motion)
- You take charge

## About us

- **Our work has impact** — Tailwind CSS is installed over 7 million times every week by millions of developers around the world, and used by the world's biggest companies to build the world's best websites. When you work here, you get to tell people things like "I work on the thing they use to build the ChatGPT website".
- **We're small, on purpose** — we have the resources to build a much bigger team, but we prefer the agility we get from staying small. We hire truly excellent people, and take pride in being able to punch well above our weight.
- **We're fully remote** — because the best person for the job probably doesn't live in our hometown, and because being able to meet your kid at the bus stop every afternoon or simply be home for the repair guy is worth a lot.
- **Self-funded and profitable** — we aren't beholden to investors or a board, and aren't burning through cash trying to make the business work. Landing the next big customer or closing the next round isn't a stress anybody has to deal with here.
- **We're highly collaborative** — we have no standing meetings, but we spend a lot of time screensharing and pairing on problems together. We strongly believe that two people working on one problem is more effective and leads to higher quality work than two people working separately.
- **We work in 8-week cycles** — we don't do 18-month projects that are irrelevant before they're even finished. Using [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) principles, we design projects we can deliver in eight weeks so we never have to wait too long before we can make fresh decisions about priorities.
- **We do it for the craft** — as a profitable company, we can afford to go the extra mile and take our time to be proud of the things we ship. We spend a lot of time on stuff that wouldn't make any sense to someone who only cared about merely solving the problemit means .
- **We're a calm company** — we work 8-hour days and 40-hour weeks, and we say no to great opportunities and ideas that might make this a more hectic place to work. We've had emergencies sure, but you could count them all on one hand.
- **We don't take ourselves too seriously** — we believe in doing great work, but we also recognize that we're building a CSS framework, not making breakthrough medical discoveries. We hide jokes in our documentation, we don't run our blog posts through a corporate PR filter, and we smile and look at the camera in our headshots.

## Pay and benefits

- Fully remote, full-time (40 hour per week) position
- $275,000 – $325,000 USD
- 4 weeks of paid vacation + 10 days for local holidays
- Annual team retreats, fun-focused trips where we get together in person to recharge and build better relationships
- $7,500
