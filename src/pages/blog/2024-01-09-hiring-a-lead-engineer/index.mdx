{/*/excerpt*/}


At Tailwind Labs, we build things that empower developers to create interfaces that inspire them and are a joy to work on. We're hiring an Engineering Lead to help us design and develop new features and products, elevate and evolve our brand, and invent new ways to help developers build interfaces they can be proud of.


This is a fully remote position with a salary of $275,000 – $325,000 USD, and is open to candidates in the Eastern (UTC-5) to Central European (UTC+1) timezones.

## What you'll do

Omnis et illo et quis praesentium debitis et in suscipit. Dolor quasi nisi. Consequatur aut minus id culpa est unde quo quibusdam. Provident dicta qui voluptate. Et cum sit. Eos quisquam dignissimos in tempore aliquam illum culpa.

While leadership experience is crucial for this role, it's important to understand that we're a very small team and management is nowhere close to being a full-time job here. You'll spend the vast majority of your time in your favorite editor, doing real engineering work alongside the rest of the team. The right person for this job cares deeply about helping others grow, but has no interest in trading in their vimrc file just yet.

- **Build new features for Tailwind CSS, Headless UI, and our supporting ecosystem.**
- **Contribute to open-source projects in our ecosystem.** Like Lightning CSS, Next.js, Vite, and more.
- **Foster a culture of craftsmanship**
- **Manage issues and contributions to our open-source projects**
- **Manage project priorities and strategically adjust scope**

You'd work on projects like:

- **Develop Tailwind CSS bundler plugins** for tools like Vite that detect classes using the module graph instead of scanning the filesystem.
- **Build a fast globbing library in Rust** optimized for our needs in Tailwind CSS, and write an educational blog post about how it works.
- **Design a set of IDE integration APIs for Tailwind CSS** that expose useful information like completions, lint warnings, class sorting order, and more.
- **Build a backwards compatibility layer for Tailwind CSS v4.0** to simplify migrating from previous versions, without polluting the new architecture.
- **Campaign for simplified Tailwind CSS integration in popular frameworks and bundlers**, by writing up specific implementation proposals for the maintainers, and creating pull requests that demonstate how the integrations would work.
- Something about Headless UI here

## Who you are

- **You hold people to a high standard, and inspire them to do their best work.** You're candid and direct with feedback, and know how to help people see the value in pushing for that extra level of quality.
- **You care about the details.** It's important to you that every variable name is just right, code comments are free of grammatical errors, and tests are named consistently. Our code is public, and it reflects on us as much as anything else we do.
- **You miss when software used to be fast.**
- **You're energized by unfamiliar territory.**

## Why work with us

- We spend our time getting stuff done, not in meetings
- **Our work has impact** — Tailwind CSS is installed over 7 million times every week by millions of developers around the world, and used by the world's biggest companies to build the world's best websites. When you work here, you get to tell people things like "I work on the thing they use to build the ChatGPT website".
- **We're small, on purpose** — we have the resources to build a much bigger team, but we prefer the agility we get from staying small. We hire truly excellent people, and take pride in being able to punch well above our weight.
- **We ship** — we don't do 18-month projects that are irrelevant before they're even finished. Using [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) principles, we design projects we can deliver in eight weeks so we never have to wait too long before we can make fresh decisions about priorities.
- **We're fully remote** — because the best person for the job probably doesn't live in our hometown, and because being able to meet your kid at the bus stop every afternoon or simply be home for the repair guy is worth a lot.
- **We're independent and profitable** — we aren't beholden to investors or a board, and aren't burning through cash trying to make the business work. Landing the next big customer or closing the next round isn't a stress anybody has to deal with here.
- **We're highly collaborative** — we have no standing meetings, but we spend a lot of time screensharing and pairing on problems together. We strongly believe that two people working on one problem is more effective and leads to higher quality work than two people working separately.
- **We do it for the craft** — as a profitable company, we can afford to go the extra mile and take our time to be proud of the things we ship. We spend a lot of time on stuff that wouldn't make any sense to someone who only cared about merely solving the problem.
- **We're a calm company** — we work 8-hour days and 40-hour weeks, and we say no to great opportunities and ideas that might make this a more hectic place to work. We've had emergencies sure, but you could count them all on one hand.
- **We don't take ourselves too seriously** — we believe in doing great work, but we also recognize that we're building a CSS framework, not making breakthrough medical discoveries. We hide jokes in our documentation, we don't run our blog posts through a corporate PR filter, and we smile and look at the camera in our headshots.

### Pay and benefits

- Illum autem officia sunt temporibus tenetur quibusdam id.
- Qui laboriosam adipisci.
- Ut et repellendus veritatis quam aut in et harum.
- Aut quibusdam laboriosam praesentium.
- Adipisci et corrupti minima deserunt debitis tenetur.
