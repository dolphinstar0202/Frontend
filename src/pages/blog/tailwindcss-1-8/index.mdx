Tailwind CSS v1.8 is now available with a handful of new utilities, a couple new features, and an exciting new experiment!

## New features

- New `font-variant-numeric` utilities ([#2305](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/2305))
- New `place-items`, `place-content`, `place-self`, `justify-items`, and `justify-self` utilities ([#2306](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/2306))
- New `preserveHtmlElements` option for `purge` ([#2283](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/2283))
- New `layers` mode for `purge` ([#2288](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/2288))
- Support configuring variants as functions ([#2309](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/2309))
- Dark mode variant (experimental) ([#2279](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/2279))

## Changes

- CSS within `@layer` at-rules are now grouped with the corresponding `@tailwind` at-rule ([#2312](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/2312))

## Deprecations

- The `conservative` purge mode has been deprecated in favor of the new `layers` mode ([#2288](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/2288))
