We think Tailwind is an amazing CSS framework, but you need more than just a CSS framework to produce visually awesome work.

Here are some resources that can help you take your Tailwind projects to the next level.

## Learning design

### Refactoring UI

[Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/book) is a design-for-developers book + video series put together by [Adam Wathan](https://twitter.com/adamwathan) (that's me, the creator of Tailwind) and [Steve Schoger](https://twitter.com/steveschoger) (who created Tailwind's default design system).

It covers literally everything we know about making things look awesome, and purchasing it is a great way to support our work on Tailwind, allowing us to spend more time developing the framework and surrounding ecosystem.

Almost 10,000 people have picked it up so far and have all sorts of [awesome things to say](https://refactoringui.com/book/kind-words/) about how it helped them improve their work.

## Images and illustrations

### Unsplash

[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) is an amazing resource for finding beautiful, high-resolution, free photos that you can use in your projects.

We use Unsplash any time we need example photos in the documentation, like for our [card components](/components/cards).

### unDraw

[unDraw](https://undraw.co/) is like Unsplash but for amazing vector illustrations, created by the amazing [Katerina Limpitsouni](https://twitter.com/ninalimpi).

They're easy to customize and perfect for landing pages, empty states, and more.

## Icons

### Heroicons UI

[Heroicons UI](https://github.com/sschoger/heroicons-ui) is a free SVG icon set created by [Steve Schoger](https://twitter.com/steveschoger). They're pre-optimized and easy to use directly in your HTML where you can customize them using Tailwind's color and sizing utilities.

## Background patterns

### Hero Patterns

[Hero Patterns](http://www.heropatterns.com/) is a set of repeatable, customizable SVG background patterns, also created by [Steve Schoger](https://twitter.com/steveschoger). They're perfect for adding a little bit of excitement to an otherwise bland background, without all the weight of a raster format like JPG or PNG.
