[Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) enhances the Tailwind development experience by providing Visual Studio Code users with advanced features such as autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting.

- **Autocomplete**. Intelligent suggestions for class names, as well as [CSS functions and directives](/docs/functions-and-directives).
- **Linting**. Highlights errors and potential bugs in both your CSS and your markup.
- **Hover Previews**. See the complete CSS for a Tailwind class name by hovering over it.
- **Syntax Highlighting**. Provides syntax definitions so that Tailwind features are highlighted correctly.
