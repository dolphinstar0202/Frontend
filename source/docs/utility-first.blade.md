<!--

    To cover:

    - Desigining with constraints
    - Avoiding premature abstraction, not needing to invent a new name every time you want to add styles to an element
    - Instead of writing CSS when you want to style something, you add existing classes to HTML
    - Built on the belief that maintaining HTML is easier than maintaining CSS
        + HTML already project specific, with Tailwind your CSS is universal
        + Title this "Myth of separation of concerns" or similar? Tie into article content
        + Inline styles have bad rep because of misguided belief that HTML should be devoid of presentational information
    - "Why not just use inline styles instead of Tailwind?"
        + Tailwind is very similar to inline styles in the sense that the goal of Tailwind is to allow you to style elements directly with no mediating layer
        + Inline styles don't support media queries or pseudo-classes, Tailwind does
        + Inline styles are a free-for-all, Tailwind is an API for your design system
