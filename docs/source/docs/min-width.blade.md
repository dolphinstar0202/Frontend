## Customizing

### Responsive, Hover, and Focus Variants

By default, only responsive variants are generated for min width utilities.

You can control which variants are generated for the min width utilities by modifying the `minWidth` property in the `modules` section of your Tailwind config file.

For example, this config will _also_ generate hover and focus variants:

```js
{
    // ...
    modules: { 
        // ...
        minWidth: ['responsive', 'hover', 'focus'],
    }
}
```

### Disabling

If you aren't using the min width utilities in your project, you can disable them entirely by setting the `minWidth` property to `false` in the `modules` section of your config file:

```js
{
    // ...
    modules: {
        // ...
        minWidth: false,
    }
}
```
