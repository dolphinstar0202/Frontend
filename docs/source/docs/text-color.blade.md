@include('_partials.class-table', [
  'rows' => $page->config['colors']->map(function ($value, $name) {
    $class = ".text-{$name}";
    $code = "color: {$value};";
    $color = implode(' ', array_reverse(explode('-', $name)));
    $description = "Set the text color of an element to {$color}.";
    return [
      $class,
      $code,
      $description,
    ];
  })->values()->all()
])

## Hover

In addition to the standard responsive variations, text colors also come in `hover:` variations that apply the given text color on hover.

@component('_partials.code-sample', ['class' => 'text-center'])
<button class="text-blue-dark hover:text-red-dark border-2 border-blue hover:border-red bg-transparent py-2 px-4 font-semibold rounded">
  Button
</button>
@endcomponent

Hover utilities can also be combined with responsive utilities by adding the responsive `{screen}:` prefix *before* the `hover:` prefix.

```html
<button class="... md:text-blue md:hover:text-red ...">Button</button>
```

## Customizing

### Responsive, Hover, and Focus Variants

By default, only responsive and hover variants are generated for text color utilities.

You can control which variants are generated for the text color utilities by modifying the `textColors` property in the `modules` section of your Tailwind config file.

For example, this config will _also_ generate focus variants:

```js
{
    // ...
    modules: { 
        // ...
        textColors: ['responsive', 'hover', 'focus'],
    }
}
```

### Disabling

If you aren't using the text color utilities in your project, you can disable them entirely by setting the `textColors` property to `false` in the `modules` section of your config file:

```js
{
    // ...
    modules: {
        // ...
        textColors: false,
    }
}
```
