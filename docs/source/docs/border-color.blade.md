@include('_partials.work-in-progress')

@include('_partials.class-table', [
  'rows' => $page->config['colors']->map(function ($value, $name) {
    $class = ".border-{$name}";
    $code = "border-color: {$value};";
    $color = implode(' ', array_reverse(explode('-', $name)));
    $description = "Set the border color of an element to {$color}.";
    return [
      $class,
      $code,
      $description,
    ];
  })->values()->all()
])

## Hover

In addition to the standard responsive variations, border colors also come in `hover:` variations that apply the given border color on hover.

@component('_partials.code-sample', ['class' => 'text-center'])
<button class="border-2 border-blue hover:border-red bg-transparent text-blue-dark hover:text-red-dark py-2 px-4 font-semibold rounded">
  Button
</button>
@endcomponent

Hover utilities can also be combined with responsive utilities by adding the responsive `{screen}:` prefix *before* the `hover:` prefix.

```html
<button class="... md:border-blue md:hover:border-red ...">Button</button>
```

## Customizing

### Responsive, Hover, and Focus Variants

By default, only responsive and hover variants are generated for border color utilities.

You can control which variants are generated for the border color utilities by modifying the `borderColors` property in the `modules` section of your Tailwind config file.

For example, this config will _also_ generate focus variants:

```js
{
    // ...
    modules: { 
        // ...
        borderColors: ['responsive', 'hover', 'focus'],
    }
}
```

### Disabling

If you aren't using the border color utilities in your project, you can disable them entirely by setting the `borderColors` property to `false` in the `modules` section of your config file:

```js
{
    // ...
    modules: {
        // ...
        borderColors: false,
    }
}
```
